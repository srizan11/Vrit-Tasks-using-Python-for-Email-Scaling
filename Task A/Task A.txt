Question: What is the shortest possible route the salesman can take, and what is the total
distance?

Answer: The travelling salesman problem is about finding the shortest route that visits all the cities exactly once and then returns to the starting city.
In our case, there are only six cities, starting from city A and ending at city A.
Because the number of cities is small, we can use brute force.
That means we try every possible route, calculate its total distance, and then pick the one with the smallest value.
The number of routes is large if the cities are many, but with six cities, it is still manageable.

In brute force, we keep city A fixed as the starting point and then look at every possible ordering of the remaining five cities.
For each order, we add the distances step by step until we return to city A.
After checking all possible routes, we can compare the totals.
The shortest route in this specific problem is A to B to E to D to F to C and then back to A, which adds up to a total of 95 kilometers.
This is the minimum route among all the options.

When the number of cities grows, brute force becomes impractical because the possible routes increase factorially.
For example, with 20 cities the number of routes becomes impossibly huge for brute force.
To handle larger numbers of cities, people use dynamic programming methods like the Held Karp algorithm, or heuristic and approximation methods like nearest neighbor, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms.
These approaches do not always give the perfect answer, but they give good results much faster and are scalable when the number of cities is very high.

So for this task with only six cities, brute force works fine, and we can directly identify the shortest route and distance.
But in the real world with many cities or delivery points, we need more advanced and scalable methods.
